# Identifying Photo Folders on the Hard Drive
# Goes through every folder on your hard drive and finds potential photo folders.
# A "photo folder" is any folder where more than half of the files are photos.
# A photo file must have the file extension .png or .jpg,
# and a photo fileâ€™s width and height must both be larger than 500 pixels.
